They\nhave cytoplasm and a cell membrane surrounded by a cell wall. The\ngenetic material is not enclosed in a nucleus. It is a single DNA loop and\nthere may be one or more small rings of DNA called plasmids.\nStudents should be able to demonstrate an understanding of the scale\nand size of cells and be able to make order of magnitude calculations,\nincluding the use of standard form.\nMS 1b,\n                  2a,\n                  2h\nWS 4.4\nUse prefixes centi, milli,\nmicro and nano.\n4.1.1.2 Animal and plant cells\nContent Key opportunities for\nskills development\nStudents should be able to explain how the main sub-cellular structures,\nincluding the nucleus, cell membranes, mitochondria, chloroplasts in\nplant cells and plasmids in bacterial cells are related to their functions.\nMost animal cells have the following parts:\n• a nucleus\n• cytoplasm\n• a cell membrane\n• mitochondria\n• ribosomes.\nIn addition to the parts found in animal cells, plant cells often have:\n• chloroplasts\n• a permanent vacuole filled with cell sap.\nPlant and algal cells also have a cell wall made of cellulose, which\nstrengthens the cell.\nWS 1.2\nRecognise, draw and\ninterpret images of cells.\n17\nGCSE Biology (8461). For exams 2018 onwards. Version 1.0\nVisit aqa.org.uk/8461 for the most up-to-date specification, resources, support and administration\nContent Key opportunities for\nskills development\nStudents should be able to use estimations and explain when they\nshould be used to judge the relative size or area of sub-cellular\nstructures.\nMS 1d,\n                  3a\nAT 7\nImages of cells in videos,\nbioviewers, photographs\nand micrographs can be\nused as comparison for\nstudents own drawings.\nRequired practical activity 1: use a light microscope to observe, draw and label a selection of plant\nand animal cells. A magnification scale must be included.\nAT skills covered by this practical activity: AT 1 and 7.\nThis practical activity also provides opportunities to develop WS and MS. Details of all skills are given in\nKey opportunities for skills development.\n4.1.1.3 Cell specialisation\nContent Key opportunities for\nskills development\nStudents should be able to, when provided with appropriate information,\nexplain how the structure of different types of cell relate to their function\nin a tissue, an organ or organ system, or the whole organism.\nCells may be specialised to carry out a particular function:\n• sperm cells, nerve cells and muscle cells in animals\n• root hair cells, xylem and phloem cells in plants.\n4.1.1.4 Cell differentiation\nContent Key opportunities for\nskills development\nStudents should be able to explain the importance of cell differentiation.\nAs an organism develops, cells differentiate to form different types of\ncells.\n• Most types of animal cell differentiate at an early stage.\n• Many types of plant cells retain the ability to differentiate throughout\nlife.\nIn mature animals, cell division is mainly restricted to repair and\nreplacement. As a cell differentiates it acquires different sub-cellular\nstructures to enable it to carry out a certain function. It has become a\nspecialised cell.\n18 Visit aqa.org.uk/8461 for the most up-to-date specification, resources, support and administration\n4.1.1.5 Microscopy\nContent Key opportunities for\nskills development\nStudents should be able to:\n• understand how microscopy techniques have developed over time\n• explain how electron microscopy has increased understanding of\nsub-cellular structures.\nLimited to the differences in magnification and resolution.\nAn electron microscope has much higher magnification and resolving\npower than a light microscope. This means that it can be used to\nstudy cells in much finer detail. This has enabled biologists to see and\nunderstand many more sub-cellular structures.\nWS 1.1\nStudents should be able to carry out calculations involving\nmagnification, real size and image size using the formula:\nmagnification = size of image\nsize of real object\nStudents should be able to express answers in standard form if\nappropriate.\nMS 1a,\n                  1b,\n                  2h,\n                  3b\nWS 4.4\nUse prefixes centi, milli,\nmicro and nano.\n19\nGCSE Biology (8461).

They underpin many aspects of the science assessment and will therefore be assessed across all papers. Key ideas in physics include: <ul class=mt-3><li class=text-black>the use of models, as in the particle model of matter or the wave models of light and of sound</li><li class=text-black>the concept of cause and effect in explaining such links as those between force and acceleration, or between changes in atomic nuclei and radioactive emissions</li><li class=text-black>the phenomena of 'action at a distance' and the related concept of the field as the key to analysing electrical, magnetic and gravitational effects</li><li class=text-black>that differences, for example between pressures or temperatures or electrical potentials, are the drivers of change</li><li class=text-black>that proportionality, for example between weight and mass of an object or between force and extension in a spring, is an important aspect of many models in science</li><li class=text-black>that physical laws and models are expressed in mathematical form</li></ul>"
