A computer program is an implementation of an algorithm written out in a programming language, and will do something when run. An algorithm is just the set of instructions that the computer program follows to complete the task. Algorithms aren't only found in computer programs though - map directions, furniture assembly instructions and recipes are examples of algorithms that a human follows to complete a task.</p><p class='info p-2 m-3'>Decomposition is the repeated subdivision of a problem into smaller sub-problems.</p><p>When tackling a large project such as a computer game, it can be helpful to think about it divided into lots of small problems, so that each sub-problem can be tackled individually. The decomposition of a multiplayer racing game can be represented with a diagram such as the one below:</p><img src='img/racing_game_decomposition.png' width='100%' class='my-3'><p>As you can see, the diagram above has divided the enormous task of making a racing game into smaller sub-problems that can each be tackled individually.</p><p class='info p-2 m-3'>Abstraction is the process of filtering out unnecessary information from a problem.</p>",
