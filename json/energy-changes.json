    "term": "Exothermic reaction",
    "meaning": "A reaction that transfers energy to the surroundings so the temperature of the surroundings increases."
  },
  {
    "term": "Endothermic reaction",
    "meaning": "A reaction that takes in energy from the surroundings so the temperature of the surroundings decreases."
