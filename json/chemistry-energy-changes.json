  {
    "term": "Conservation of energy",
    "meaning": "The idea that energy cannot be created or destroyed. If a reaction transfers energy to the surroundings the product molecules must have less energy than the reactants, by the amount transferred."
  },
  {
    "term": "Exothermic reaction",
    "meaning": "A reaction that transfers energy to the surroundings so the temperature of the surroundings increases."
  },
  {
    "term": "Endothermic reaction",
    "meaning": "A reaction that takes in energy from the surroundings so the temperature of the surroundings decreases."
  },
  {
    "term": "Activation energy",
    "meaning": "The minimum amount of energy that particles must have to react."
  },
  {
    "term": "Bond energy",
    "meaning": "The amount of energy required to break or form a particular type of covalent bond. Measured in kJ/mol."

  {
    "term": "Chemical cell",
    "meaning": "A type of cell containing chemicals which react to produce electricity"
  },
  {
    "term": "Reaction profile",
    "meaning": "A graph used to show the relative energies of reactants and products, the activation energy and the overall energy change of a reaction"
  },
  {
    "term": "Alkaline batteries",
    "meaning": "A type of non-rechargeable battery."
  },
  {
    "term": "Non-rechargeable cell/battery",
    "meaning": "A cell/battery where the reaction stops if one of the reactants is used up."
  },
  {
    "term": "Rechargeable cell/battery",
    "meaning": "A cell/battery using a reaction that can be reversed when an external electrical current is supplied."
  },
  {
    "term": "Fuel cells",
    "meaning": "A type of cell supplied with an external source of fuel, which is oxidised electrochemically to produce a potential difference."
  },
  {
    "term": "Hydrogen fuel cell",
    "meaning": "A type of fuel cell using hydrogen as fuel, which produces water as the only waste product."
